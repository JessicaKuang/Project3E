    "Scientific Question: How does mortality risk associates with short sleeping duration?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep duration is known to be associated with mortality rate. Many previous studies show that 7h is the optimal length of sleep, and sleeping for more than 8h or less than 6h both significantly increases all-cause mortality. In my study, I am trying to specifically study how significantly short sleeping duration influences mortality. The data I am using comes from the scientific article: Sleep duration, mortality and the influence of age. URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5680380/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific Hypothesis: If the sleeping duration is shorter than the optimal length, then the risk of mortality increases\n",
    "\n",
    "From the data, I am going to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for each sleep duration group. Then, by using HR, I can use ttest to calculate the p-value to test if short sleep significantly increases mortality. I could not find raw data for my topic. The data I am using is manually imported into Python from the scientific article: Sleep duration, mortality and the influence of age. URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5680380/\n",
